# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root.
- `docs/adr/` for ADRs that touch the area being changed.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. If the concept is missing, note it for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
